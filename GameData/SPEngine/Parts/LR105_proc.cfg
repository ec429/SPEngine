	@description = Kerolox sustainer engine, like LR105 family.  Typically used in parallel-staging architectures, ground-lit alongside boosters.  As a sustainer engine, the L-class has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.
