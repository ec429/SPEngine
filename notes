Semi-Procedural Engines

Within an engine Class, fix point designs rather like tooling a proctank.
Variables: size (affects mass, thrust, cost), nIgnitions (affects cost), others?
Once you've fixed a design, you can upgrade it as you unlock techs.

Classes:
A: Alcohol/LOx atmospheric engine.  Cheap'n'easy for the low TLs.  Examples include A4, A6, RD-100, XLR11 (Bell X-1).
B: Small hypergolic sustainer engine.  Examples include Aerobee and very early AJ-10s.
C: Small methalox vacuum engine.  E.g. RL10-CH₄.
D: Pressure-fed hypergolic vacuum engine.  Examples include AJ10 family (Able, Delta, Apollo SPS...).
E: Large hypergolic vacuum engine.  E.g. LR91 (Titan II onwards).
F: Huge kerolox atmospheric engine.  Examples include E-1, F-1.
G: Pump-fed hypergolic vacuum engine.  Examples include Agena (Bell XLR81).
H: Staged-combustion hydrolox sustainer engine.  E.g. RS25.
J: Large hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. J-2.
K: Kerolox atmospheric engine (not huge).  Examples include X405, LR79/89/H-1, LR87 (Titan I), Merlin1.
L: Kerolox sustainer engine.  Examples include LR105, RD-108.
M: Huge hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. M-1.
N: Large staged-combustion kerolox engine.  E.g. NK series.
P: Staged-combustion hypergolic engine.  E.g. Proton (RD-253 etc.).
Q: Throttleable small hydrolox vacuum engine.  Based on RL10 deep-throttling projects (e.g. for Lunex).
R: Small hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. RL10.
S: Small staged-combustion kerolox engine.  E.g. RD-58.
T: Large hypergolic atmospheric engine.  E.g. LR87 (Titan II onwards).
U: Staged-combustion methalox sustainer engine.  E.g. Raptor, BE-4.
V: Kerolox vacuum engine.  E.g. LR91 (Titan I), Merlin1Vac.
X: Kerosene/peroxide pump-fed engine.  Examples include British Gamma and Stentor.
Y: Large staged-combustion kerolox vacuum engine.  E.g. NK-V series.
Z: Throttleable hypergolic vacuum engine.  E.g. LMDE.
