Semi-Procedural Engines

Within an engine Class, fix point designs rather like tooling a proctank.
Variables: size (affects mass, thrust, cost), nIgnitions (affects cost), others?
Once you've fixed a design, you can upgrade it as you unlock techs.

Classes:
A: Alcohol/LOx atmospheric engine (US style).  Primitive, but less so than Russian-style.  Examples include A4, A6, XLR11 (Bell X-1).
a: Alcohol/LOx atmospheric engine (Russian style).  Cheap'n'easy for the low TLs.  Examples include RD-100 series.
B: Small hypergolic sustainer engine.  Examples include Aerobee and very early AJ-10s.
C: Small methalox vacuum engine.  E.g. RL10-CH₄.  But most of the actual research was done with Flox/CH₄, do we go down that route instead?
D: Pressure-fed hypergolic vacuum engine.  Examples include AJ10 family (Able, Delta, Apollo SPS...).
E: Large hypergolic vacuum engine.  E.g. LR91 (Titan II onwards).
F: Huge kerolox atmospheric engine.  Examples include E-1, F-1.
G: Pump-fed hypergolic vacuum engine.  Examples include Agena (Bell XLR81).
H: Staged-combustion hydrolox sustainer engine.  E.g. RS25.
J: Large hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. J-2.
K: Kerolox atmospheric engine (not huge).  Examples include X405, LR79/89/H-1, LR87 (Titan I), Merlin1.
k: Kerolox vernier engine.  Examples include LR101.
L: Kerolox sustainer engine.  Examples include LR105, RD-108.
M: Huge hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. M-1.
N: Large staged-combustion kerolox engine.  E.g. NK series.
n: Medium staged-combustion kerolox engine.  E.g. NK-9.
O: Staged-combustion hypergolic vacuum engine.  E.g. RD-0210 (Proton upper stage).
P: Staged-combustion hypergolic engine.  E.g. Proton (RD-253 etc.).
Q: Throttleable small hydrolox vacuum engine.  Based on RL10 deep-throttling projects (e.g. for Lunex).
R: Small hydrolox vacuum engine.  E.g. RL10.
S: Small staged-combustion kerolox engine.  E.g. RD-58.
T: Large hypergolic atmospheric engine.  E.g. LR87 (Titan II onwards).
U: Staged-combustion methalox sustainer engine.  E.g. Raptor, BE-4.
V: Kerolox vacuum engine.  E.g. LR91 (Titan I), Merlin1Vac.
W: Kerosene/peroxide pump-fed vacuum engine.  Examples include British Gamma 2.
X: Kerosene/peroxide pump-fed atmospheric engine.  Examples include British Gamma 8 and Stentor.
Y: Large staged-combustion kerolox vacuum engine.  E.g. NK-V series.
y: Medium staged-combustion kerolox vacuum engine.  E.g. NK-9V.
Z: Throttleable hypergolic vacuum engine.  E.g. LMDE.

TODO: maybe extend X class with earlier examples based on Seymonsters' UK Rockets mod (Sprite, Super Sprite, Spectre, Snarler/Screamer)?  But changing indices of existing TLs causes trouble, so we need to first migrate to storing the puRequired name rather than the TL number in the DesignLibrary.  (Alternatively, an x-class for pure-peroxide engines is also a possibility, though doesn't cover all engines we care about.  Or maybe x-class is pressure-fed?  But Spectre is a pump-fed, throttleable, HTP/kero engine and might be interesting for landers!)  Also, the techlevel needs to store configName (rather than ModuleSPEngine generating it) for consistent testf/lite names (existing du etc.).
